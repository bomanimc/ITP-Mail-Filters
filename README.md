# Mail Filters for an ITP Inbox

This repository includes an export of email filters I use to help manage my NYU inbox as an ITP student and member of the high-volume itp-students listserv. I'll be updating this repository intermittently as I make more filters based on the tagging patterns I discover over time. Feel free to fork this set of email filters and customize them to your needs. 

## Usage
1) Clone or download this repository (using the green "Clone or Download" button on the right-side of this repositories root directory page on GitHub. The cloned/downloaded folder should include the file `mailFilters.xml`.
2) Open your NYU ITP Gmail account. In Gmail, upload the `mailFilters.xml` file (Settings > Filters and Blocked Address > Import filters > Browse > select `mailFilters.xml` > Open > Create Filters). This will automatically create the necessary labels. You can delete any filters that you don't want.

## Customizing Filters
If you'd like to edit this set of filters to your needs, a few options are:
1) Download the `mailFilters.xml` file and upload to your Gmail account following the steps above. Once they are in Gmail, you can use the Gmail UI to edit them.
2) Fork this repository and edit the XML directly. 

_ps. If you make any helpful filters that aren't included here, I'd love to know!_
